Built fbat so that:

Don't have to do the plink conversion from vcf..
  can use the tped format which is super fast.

And don't have to recode the variants, as with the fbat program.

Will output a regular table â€¦ rather than a log file.

Will allow different weighting functions which can bring in allele freqs from caviar.

Used a modular approach coded in python, making it easy to modify.

Always reports the minor allele .. even when the ref and alt are switched!
